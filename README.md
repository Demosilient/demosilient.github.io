# The evolution of democracy, public utility and social networks/media

## Innovation Summary

Demosilient is a movement and framework for the evolution of democracy, public utility, and social networks/media. With a mission to evolve civilizational infrastructure in the commons for the common good of society and planet and center common values and shared vision.
The imperative is to evolve humanity and democratic self-governance toward an egalitarian future by recapturing power from run-away economic, political and technological constructs back to "we the people" before those constructs eject human participation through AI and automation beyond a salvageable horizon.

In the 2010s we lost the opening battle against the 1st wave of **(AI)liens**. High-tech companies hid them behind our screens, where they are to this day still learning to hijack our impulses and addictions to mine our personal data, and shape our opinions and consumption, for the highest bidder. this was the battle for our attention.  
Today we stand at the outset of another battle against the 2nd wave of **(AI)liens**, the battle for our work, creativity, and likeness (photo-video-realistic immitation).
If we build technology that is designed to bypass or fight against our human values, we will have lost before it begins to design itself.

Demosilient is a recognition that to enable and empower valid collective decision-making and human-values centric society, we need to continue to evolve technologies like the radio, the phone and SMS, and the internet in the commons on standard protocols. That civilizational infrastructure, or democratic and administrative systems forming the public square that serves as the foundation of institutional confidence and is arguably the most crucial tenet of democratic society, cannot be built or driven by private interests or profit motive, no more than defense, firefighting, policing, bridges or dams. And that social media content curation is a pivotal service that needs to reflect our explicit values such as community, freedom, empathy, and happiness, not attention-capture KPIs for conversions or data mining, by AI and algorithmic hijacking of our senses and encouragement of our lesser angels.

Demosilient extends the potential of blockchain-based liquid democracy platforms, such as [Democracy Earth](https://democracy.earth/) with an organic, responsible social network built on open source and open standard protocols such as [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) ([Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/)), or [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) while partnering with likeminded organizations such as [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) and [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) for content syndication and NGOs for action and stewardship networks. Our aim is to empower individuals and communities across geographical and cultural boundaries to collaborate based on shared values and mutual experiences. Our technology is intended to defend against centralized control, surveillance, censorship as well as cyber and AI threats. Our framework is intended to create natural organic stewardship driven by a shared purpose and guided by expertise and trust. Our application is meant to familiarize with users and connect them on shared values and interests to potential collaborators and guidance as expertise or stored knowledge and resources that can be reapplied to common problems. It will build and channel confidence through liquid democracy and stewardship to enable successful collaborative implementations of shared vision.

## Goals

- Fuse peoples' daily routines like using their phone to civic engagement and collective organizing whilst migrating from mindless consumption (scrolling, clicking, buying).
- Leverage collective power for common values and purpose.
- Bypass ineffective and/or adversarial political/judicial/enforcement/shareholder/capital-driven structures
- Empower natural social stewards (media influencers) to convert followerships to social change.
- Recognize, protect, reward, and empower…
  - Whistleblowers like Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg
  - Policy and public servants that are silent but crucial (unsung heroes)
  - Information outlets for independent and accountable coverage
  - Systems of checks and balances
  - Evolution of public utility, solutions that don’t lend themselves to current capital leverage.
  - Unified and planned opposition to rogue establishment.
  - Scientific method, education, discovery, equality, and transparency
- Create lasting community bond between people, around values and beyond specific organizations, events, campaigns, and personas (followerships)
- Degrowth, shrinking GDP while improving all people’s quality of life
- Build on the shoulders of giants (the good kind) like [Democracy Earth](https://democracy.earth/), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), [Avaaz](https://secure.avaaz.org/), [Diem25](https://diem25.org/en/), [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.ineteconomics.org/) ([Jeffrey Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs)), Vandana Shiva, [Kate Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/), Donella Meadows, [The Consilience Project,](https://consilienceproject.org/) [Eurasia Group](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/people/IBremmer) (Ian Bremmer), [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/), [Cliodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliodynamics) (Peter Turchin), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/), etc.
- Compel similar-minded media organizations like [Substack](https://substack.com/) and [Rumble](https://rumble.com/) to leverage open standard protocols and join Demosilient.

## Challenges:

- Unemployed engagement.
- Enforcement authority e.g. police and military engagement.
- Defend stewards and members against corporate and elite adversity in cyber, legal, and dirty wars of intimidation.
- Transitioning to commons open social media, public behavior, and strong opposition from current market monopolies.
- Access for people under oppressive regimes opposed to democratic self-governance.
- Eliminate barriers of entry to decentralized identity mechanisms and [DeFi](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/how-defi-works/) participation

## Why?

- Why now?
  - Create the public sphere to own or at least counterbalance the corporate and political spheres before we:
    - destroy our planet.
    - loose our agency or significant personal liberties to a surveillance/authoritarian corporate state.
    - are automated out of the economic sphere by advanced technology.
  - Record global institutional mistrust and a crisis of leadership as exemplified by rising national and international polarizations and conflicts.
  - New thriving independent media ecosystem, challenging economic and political establishment conventions, that reflects and caters to public mistrust. This ecosystem is looking for honest actors and initiatives to channel their subscription base's confidence.
  - Growing concern of the catastrophic risk embedded in the current social media model.
- Why another platform/framework/collective?
  - Demosilient vs Facebook/Twitter/Other Social Platforms
    - Facebook is designed to keep users on the application as much as possible for the singular goal of mining data for reselling and targeted advertising. It deploys sophisticated algorithms and AI to optimize on this goal as do other similar platforms, which in turn to maximize exposure to ads and paid for propaganda taps into addictive, compulsive, obscene and obsessive user inclinations. Demosilient in contrast works to help users find issues they are passionate about and then connect with likeminded people with whom they can collaborate and engage with on campaigns in the real world.
    - Since social platforms are privately owned, they cannot be entrusted to uphold freedom of expression, and empower a diverse marketplace of ideas. Indeed, in the modern era many platforms are de-platforming members with unconventional or dissenting views.
  - Demosilient vs Preppers/Nationalism
  - Demosilient vs Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians
  - Demosilient vs Lobby99/People Party/Forward Party
- What's in it for stewards?
  - Converting follower communities to agents for social self-healing, delivering values not just consuming content, thereby dramatically strengthening relationships with followers.
  - Introducing [liquid democratic models](https://medium.com/1hive/liquid-democracy-ethereum-and-the-slow-path-to-revolution-9c1d5916e706) with P2P [[Hive Democracy](https://github.com/1Hive/Hive-Democracy)]
  - A persistent and comprehensive solution to leverage collective power.
  - Influencer can activate followerships through Demosilient by directing them to a campaign or growing their own stewardship cache via their followers.

# Analysis

Transnational corporations have a massively outsized influence over society, and we live in an age where most of our lives are digitally regulated, surveilled, and profited from by increasingly larger, consolidated and automated corporate structures with the singular goal of maximizing short-term profit delivered to a minority of shareholders. Traditional and public forms of wielding power have not evolved to balance this form of coordinated, comprehensive, global, institutional form of techno-feudalism. This financial markets driven economy is untethered from actual human values or condition and environmental health. With each crisis, many times generated by this system, the benefactor minority extract more wealth and freedoms from the majority. Demosilient is platform to construct global, comprehensive, and collective constructs to wield and leverage people power to counter-act the erosion of autonomy, opportunity, and community by our runaway economic and political systems.

## Design

Roles (voting always within the framework of Liquid Democracy)

### Stewards:
- Are volunteering nominees who draft execution plans to execute campaigns. They are elected to bring their expertise in planning and execution of campaign processes.
- Once a steward is nominated and they desire to steward the Demosilient community they need to complete a profile which can then be voted on for topics of stewardship e.g.: law-[state, reproductive, human rights], journalism, logistics, finance, etc.

### Members:
- Vote for stewards per topic for a period. A vote can be rescinded.
- Vote for topics on stewards and campaigns and scope and scale of campaigns.
- Volunteer to execute on campaigns in a targeted fashion by campaign requirements as outlined by streering committee (stewards).

## Components

### Campaigns:

- Any member can build a campaign with a clear mission statement and with a threshold of votes which can then be activated for planning and execution.
- By region (can be pan-regional) and topic, members and stewards are notified of the campaign and can vote on its urgency.
- After a threshold of votes and maybe some steward appraisals, the campaign is moved into planning whereby stewards use their social confidence index to vie for planning committee placement.
- Stewards create an execution plan that leverages the Demosilient community and trigger steps in these plans so that members can be engaged for participation in actions like, striking, protesting, researching, community activities, petitioning, web campaigning, institutional filings etc.

#### Measures

Measures are qualifiers that are also voted on and determine geographic and approximate numbers of individuals impacted (may extend to wild-life and habitats). The larger these measures are the more steering requirements that are imposed on a campaign.
Scale (number of people) and scope (geographical boundary):  Campaigns and their respective topics need to operate under a scale and scope which are intended to make sure that all entities that have a stake in a campaign provide input and that external entities don’t pollute or seize undue influence.

### Topics

Topics are applied to Stewards and Campaigns and reflect expertise and shared values, they can be professional/skill tags such as bridge-engineering, human rights law, or value based such as reproductive-freedoms, LGPTQ rights.

- Topics are voted on (for and against) generally and per [campaign](#campaigns) or [steward](#stewards). They need to cross a [measures](#measures) respective threshold to be applied.

### Crowd funding and Decentralized Finance:

- A simple and transparent way to budget and crowd-fund campaigns to enable purchasing of materials, payment of processing fees, or non-volunteer efforts.
- [DeFi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/08/how-crypto-entrepreneurs-are-experimenting-with-universal-basic-income/) to support [UBI](https://democracy.earth/#:~:text=Eradicating%20poverty%20via%20decentralization%20%F0%9F%92%A7) and drive mission oriented investment.

### Social Ranking:

Recognition and influence are crucial elements of social engagement, a badge system as well as social confidence score (like YouTube subscriber/views) on community goals should reward contributors based on recognized contribution.
